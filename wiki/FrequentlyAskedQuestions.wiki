= I followed your configuration instructions and Gallio finds the assembly but no tests are loaded? =

There could be several reasons for this problem:

  #  Are your specification fixtures declared public? Gallio will only look for exported (or public) types so any specification fixture you declare must be declared public to be found.

  #  Is your specification fixture decorated with the [ConcordionTest] attribute?  The Gallio.ConcordionAdapter plugin will only consider classes with this attribute as a specification to run.

  #  To run Concordion tests properly Gallio must be using the Local runner.  See the Gallio help for more on this. (This is a bit of a limitation right now, but I hope to resolve this issue in the future)

  # Does your specification assembly have the ConcordionAssembly attribute on it?

  # Does your specification reference the Concordion.dll assembly?
  
  # Can Concordion find the specification configuration file (is it in the same directory as your specification assembly)?

  # Does the specification configuration file point to a valid BaseInputDirectory?

  # Are your fixture/specification pairings properly named?  For example if my specification is Account.html then my fixure must be named AccountTest.cs otherwise Concordion cannot make the link.
