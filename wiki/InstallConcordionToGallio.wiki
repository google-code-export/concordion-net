#summary How To Install Concordion to Gallio

= Requirements =

You will need the following:

  * Gallio v3.0.5.546 installed. (The plugin only works with this version currently)
  * Concordion installed to a directory on your local machine (we will call this CONCORDION_HOME)


= Procedure =

  # Install Gallio
  # Install Concordion
  # Set the plugin directory to point to CONCORDION_HOME
  # Restart Gallio

= Caveats =

  * The Concordion Adapter only works with v3.0.5.546 of Gallio currently.  Plans to expand this to other releases is in the works.
  * After you set the plugin directory you will have to restart Gallio for Gallio to be able to find and load the plugin properly.
  * This guide only applies to the Icarus GUI Test Runner.
